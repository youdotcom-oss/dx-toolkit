            This is a manually triggered review for an external contribution.

            Please provide a comprehensive review focusing on:
            - Compliance with project coding standards (see AGENTS.md and package-specific AGENTS.md)
            - Proper test coverage for new functionality
            - Documentation for public APIs
            - Security considerations (OWASP top 10, command injection, XSS)
            - Breaking changes to public APIs
            - License compliance for new dependencies

            Be welcoming but thorough. Use inline comments for code-specific feedback.
            Use `gh pr view ${{ inputs.pr_number }}` and `gh pr diff ${{ inputs.pr_number }}` to examine the changes.
